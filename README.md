# Facebook's Conversions API for Google Tag Manager(server-side)

The Conversions API allows advertisers to send web events from their servers directly to Facebook. Server events are linked to a pixel and are processed like browser pixel events. This means that server events are used in measurement, reporting, and optimization in the same way as browser pixel events. [Learn More](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api).

Google Tag Manager(GTM) have released support for their [server-side](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/serverside/) support for sharing customer actions with analytics partners directly from Advertisers' servers. This repository contains the Templates(Client and Tag) that advertisers can install on their GTM's Tagging server and send to Facebook's Conversions API.

This template is a server-side client that can be deployed on a tagging server to listen to events from advertisers' websites and run various tags on the events it receives.

(This feature may not be available to you. Contact your Facebook representative for more details.)
